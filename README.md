# Task Management Web Application

Welcome to my repository for the Task Management Web Application project! This project combines all the skills I've learned so far into a fully functional, dynamic web application built on a full-stack Django framework.

## Project Overview

I’m building a task management app with team collaboration features. The idea is to allow users to create tasks, assign them to team members, set deadlines, and track progress in real-time. My main goal is to develop a tool that makes teamwork more efficient and helps everyone stay on track.

### Key Product Goals
- **Task Creation & Assignment:** Users can easily create, edit, and delete tasks while assigning them to the appropriate team members.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** The app focuses on real-time updates so that every change is instantly visible to the entire team.
- **Deadline & Progress Tracking:** An intuitive dashboard will let users set deadlines and monitor progress clearly.

### Target Customers
This app is designed for small to medium teams, startups, and project managers who need a simple yet powerful solution for managing tasks and collaborating in real-time.

### Customer Needs Addressed
- Quick and effective collaboration
- Clear visibility into task progress and accountability
- An easy-to-use, centralized tool for managing projects

### Vision Statement
*“I want to empower teams to work smarter, not harder. My task management app brings real-time collaboration, seamless task tracking, and agile project management together in one user-friendly platform to boost productivity and teamwork.”*

## Sprint Planning

I’ve broken down my project into four sprints, each lasting about two weeks, to manage development in an agile and iterative way.

### Sprint 1 – Laying the Groundwork & User Authentication
- **Goal/Deliverable:** Set up the Django project and create the primary app. Implement user registration, login, logout, and basic profile creation.
- **Contribution:** Establishes a secure and solid foundation so that only authenticated users can access the app.

### Sprint 2 – Building Core Task Management
- **Goal/Deliverable:** Develop the core functionality for task management, including creating, assigning, updating, and deleting tasks. Set up the necessary database models and CRUD operations.
- **Contribution:** Provides the backbone of the app; without these features, there is no task management.

### Sprint 3 – Adding Real-Time Collaboration & AJAX
- **Goal/Deliverable:** Integrate JavaScript and AJAX to ensure that updates happen in real-time. This includes live task updates, notifications, and dynamic page content without full reloads.
- **Contribution:** Enhances the user experience by making the app feel dynamic and interactive—a key differentiator of my product.

### Sprint 4 – Polishing UI/UX, Testing, & Deployment Preparation
- **Goal/Deliverable:** Refine the user interface, improve error handling, and ensure accessibility. Thoroughly test the application and prepare for deployment.
- **Contribution:** Ensures the final product is polished, bug-free, and ready for real-world use, with a consistent and appealing design.
